The Hostel Management System is developed for automating the activities of hostel. The 
software will be great relief to the employees. This software will help user in case of 
reporting, registration and searching the information about residents and rooms. The aim 
of the Hostel Management System is to carry out the activities of Hostel in an efficient way. 
It will take the operations of Hostel to an upper level by providing faster access to data and 
allowing addition, upgradation, modification, and deletion of data in a very systematic and 
reliable manner. 
After make an observation on the current process of hostel management at  
school, it found that every single thing is done completely by manual.  
Currently, the managements are preferring online system for easy process rather than 
offline mood system . It is because there are facing problem such as corrupted of data. The 
data  
about information of student hostel are store and keep not very well and  
systematically.  
In the current process, the data are stored into the file but not in the  
database which is lead to data duplication, repetitive data, and isolation of data from  
one to another. It is also worried of something happen to the file, then all the data will  
lost.  
In the current manual system, it will very difficult to find the hostel record  
and other information of student manually. Because it has been keep on the paper and  
it is easy to loss. It also consume time to search the paper of student hostel record one  
by one.  
The manual system requires longer time for allocation the student to  
respective hostel, dorm, and bed. 
Besides that, the manual application will lead toward a hassle data  
management for faster student allocation as well as managing the data for faster task  
such as studentâ€™s activities, student outing record and managing visitors.
